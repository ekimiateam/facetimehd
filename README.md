facetimehd-ppa
==============

This is my fork of [patjak/facetimehd][upstream] to package it for
Ubuntu.

Use this [ppa] for Ubuntu.  You can raise issues here for
ppa/Ubuntu issues, [upstream] for driver functionality.


facetimehd
==========

Linux driver for the Facetime HD (Broadcom 1570) PCIe webcam
found in recent Macbooks.

This driver is experimental. Use at your own risk.
